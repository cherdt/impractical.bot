# DIY Gist Chatbots

I created a tool that will allow anyone to experiment with NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) chatbots without writing any Python code.

I plan to expand on this idea, but it is usable now. In order to create your own bot:

* Create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account
* Create a "gist" or fork my demo gist: [Greetings Bot](https://gist.github.com/cherdt/f29a847a08fdc24a42a8e427e079310c)
* Customize the name, match, and replies elements
* Note your username and the unique ID of your gist (a hash value, a 64-character string of letters and numbers)
* Visit http://impractical.bot/chat/user/hash, replacing "user" with your GitHub username and "hash" with the unique ID of your gist.

You can now interact with your custom bot, or share the link with your friends!
